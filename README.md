## WARNING

This projects gets its data from an unsecured request (http://) so trying to run it on a secured site will not work for most browsers. It will however work on a local server (e.g running npm-start) or running it on an also unsecured site. As a standalone there should be no problems or cause for concern regarding data breaches as no delicate information is sent out. That is all. Enjoy


Also if you can reference a secure site to fetch the data and just as user friendly from that would be really appreciated
